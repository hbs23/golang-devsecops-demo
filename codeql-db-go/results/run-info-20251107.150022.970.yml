  queryHelp: "# Incomplete regular expression for hostnames\nSanitizing untrusted\
    \ URLs is an important technique for preventing attacks such as request forgeries\
    \ and malicious redirections. Often, this is done by checking that the host of\
    \ a URL is in a set of allowed hosts.\n\nIf a regular expression implements such\
    \ a check, it is easy to accidentally make the check too permissive by not escaping\
    \ regular-expression meta-characters such as `.`.\n\nEven if the check is not\
    \ used in a security-critical context, the incomplete check may still cause undesirable\
    \ behavior when it accidentally succeeds.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEscape all meta-characters\
    \ appropriately when constructing regular expressions for security checks, paying\
    \ special attention to the `.` meta-character.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following\
    \ example code checks that a URL redirection will reach the `example.com` domain,\
    \ or one of its subdomains.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"errors\"\
    \n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"regexp\"\n)\n\nfunc checkRedirect(req *http.Request, via\
    \ []*http.Request) error {\n\t// BAD: the host of `req.URL` may be controlled\
    \ by an attacker\n\tre := \"^((www|beta).)?example.com/\"\n\tif matched, _ :=\
    \ regexp.MatchString(re, req.URL.Host); matched {\n\t\treturn nil\n\t}\n\treturn\
    \ errors.New(\"Invalid redirect\")\n}\n\n```\nThe check is however easy to bypass\
    \ because the unescaped `.` allows for any character before `example.com`, effectively\
    \ allowing the redirect to go to an attacker-controlled domain such as `wwwXexample.com`.\n\
    \nAddress this vulnerability by escaping `.` appropriately:\n\n\n```go\npackage\
    \ main\n\nimport (\n\t\"errors\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"regexp\"\n)\n\nfunc checkRedirectGood(req\
    \ *http.Request, via []*http.Request) error {\n\t// GOOD: the host of `req.URL`\
    \ must be `example.com`, `www.example.com` or `beta.example.com`\n\tre := \"^((www|beta)\\\

    \ matched {\n\t\treturn nil\n\t}\n\treturn errors.New(\"Invalid redirect\")\n\
    }\n\n```\nYou may also want to consider using raw string literals to avoid having\
    \ to escape backslashes:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"errors\"\n\t\
    \"net/http\"\n\t\"regexp\"\n)\n\nfunc checkRedirectGood2(req *http.Request, via\

  queryHelp: "# Incomplete URL scheme check\nURLs with the special scheme `javascript`\
    \ can be used to encode JavaScript code to be executed when the URL is visited.\
    \ While this is a powerful mechanism for creating feature-rich and responsive\
    \ web applications, it is also a potential security risk: if the URL comes from\
    \ an untrusted source, it might contain harmful JavaScript code. For this reason,\

  queryHelp: "# Missing regular expression anchor\nSanitizing untrusted input with\

    \ untrusted input against regular expressions without anchors such as `^` or `$`.\
    \ Malicious input can bypass such security checks by embedding one of the allowed\
    \ patterns in an unexpected location.\n\nEven if the matching is not done in a\
    \ security-critical context, it may still cause undesirable behavior when the\
    \ regular expression accidentally matches.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse anchors\
    \ to ensure that regular expressions match at the expected locations.\n\n\n##\
    \ Example\nThe following example code checks that a URL redirection will reach\
    \ the `example.com` domain, or one of its subdomains, and not some malicious site.\n\
    \n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"errors\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"regexp\"\
    \n)\n\nfunc checkRedirect2(req *http.Request, via []*http.Request) error {\n\t\
    // BAD: the host of `req.URL` may be controlled by an attacker\n\tre := \"https?://www\\\
    \\.example\\\\.com/\"\n\tif matched, _ := regexp.MatchString(re, req.URL.String());\
    \ matched {\n\t\treturn nil\n\t}\n\treturn errors.New(\"Invalid redirect\")\n\
    }\n\n```\nThe check with the regular expression match is, however, easy to bypass.\
    \ For example, the string `http://example.com/` can be embedded in the query string\
    \ component: `http://evil-example.net/?x=http://example.com/`.\n\nAddress these\
    \ shortcomings by using anchors in the regular expression instead:\n\n\n```go\n\
    package main\n\nimport (\n\t\"errors\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"regexp\"\n)\n\nfunc\
    \ checkRedirect2Good(req *http.Request, via []*http.Request) error {\n\t// GOOD:\
    \ the host of `req.URL` cannot be controlled by an attacker\n\tre := \"^https?://www\\\

    \ matched {\n\t\treturn nil\n\t}\n\treturn errors.New(\"Invalid redirect\")\n\
    }\n\n```\nA related mistake is to write a regular expression with multiple alternatives,\
    \ but to only anchor one of the alternatives. As an example, the regular expression\
    \ `^www\\.example\\.com|beta\\.example\\.com` will match the host `evil.beta.example.com`\
    \ because the regular expression is parsed as `(^www\\.example\\.com)|(beta\\\
    .example\\.com)/`, so the second alternative `beta\\.example\\.com` is not anchored\
    \ at the beginning of the string.\n\nWhen checking for a domain name that may\
    \ have subdomains, it is important to anchor the regular expression or ensure\
    \ that the domain name is prefixed with a dot.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport\
    \ (\n\t\"regexp\"\n)\n\nfunc checkSubdomain(domain String) {\n\t// Checking strictly\
    \ that the domain is `example.com`.\n\tre := \"^example\\\\.com$\"\n\tif matched,\
    \ _ := regexp.MatchString(re, domain); matched {\n\t\t// domain is good.\n\t}\n\
    \n\t// GOOD: Alternatively, check the domain is `example.com` or a subdomain of\
    \ `example.com`.\n\tre2 := \"(^|\\\\.)example\\\\.com$\"\n\n\tif matched, _ :=\
    \ regexp.MatchString(re2, domain); matched {\n\t\t// domain is good.\n\t}\n}\n\
    \n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)\n\

  queryHelp: "# Suspicious characters in a regular expression\nWhen a character in\
    \ a string literal or regular expression literal is preceded by a backslash, it\
    \ is interpreted as part of an escape sequence. For example, the escape sequence\
    \ `\\n` in a string literal corresponds to a single `newline` character, and not\
    \ the `\\` and `n` characters. There are two Go escape sequences that could produce\
    \ surprising results. First, `regexp.Compile(\"\\a\")` matches the bell character,\
    \ whereas `regexp.Compile(\"\\\\A\")` matches the start of text and `regexp.Compile(\"\
    \\\\a\")` is a Vim (but not Go) regular expression matching any alphabetic character.\
    \ Second, `regexp.Compile(\"\\b\")` matches a backspace, whereas `regexp.Compile(\"\
    \\\\b\")` matches the start of a word. Confusing one for the other could lead\
    \ to a regular expression passing or failing much more often than expected, with\
    \ potential security consequences. Note this is less of a problem than in some\
    \ other languages because in Go, only valid escape sequences are accepted, both\
    \ in an ordinary string (for example, `s := \"\\k\"` will not compile as there\
    \ is no such escape sequence) and in regular expressions (for example, `regexp.MustCompile(\"\
    \\\\k\")` will panic as `\\k` does not refer to a character class or other special\
    \ token according to Go's regular expression grammar).\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\
    Ensure that the right number of backslashes is used when escaping characters in\
    \ strings and regular expressions.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code\
    \ fails to check for a forbidden word in an input string:\n\n\n```go\npackage\
    \ main\n\nimport \"regexp\"\n\nfunc broken(hostNames []byte) string {\n\tvar hostRe\
    \ = regexp.MustCompile(\"\\bforbidden.host.org\")\n\tif hostRe.Match(hostNames)\
    \ {\n\t\treturn \"Must not target forbidden.host.org\"\n\t} else {\n\t\t// This\
    \ will be reached even if hostNames is exactly \"forbidden.host.org\",\n\t\t//\
    \ because the literal backspace is not matched\n\t\treturn \"\"\n\t}\n}\n\n```\n\
    The check does not work, but can be fixed by escaping the backslash:\n\n\n```go\n\
    package main\n\nimport \"regexp\"\n\nfunc fixed(hostNames []byte) string {\n\t\
    var hostRe = regexp.MustCompile(`\\bforbidden.host.org`)\n\tif hostRe.Match(hostNames)\
    \ {\n\t\treturn \"Must not target forbidden.host.org\"\n\t} else {\n\t\t// hostNames\
    \ definitely doesn't contain a word \"forbidden.host.org\", as \"\\\\b\"\n\t\t\
    // is the start-of-word anchor, not a literal backspace.\n\t\treturn \"\"\n\t\
    }\n}\n\n```\nAlternatively, you can use backtick-delimited raw string literals.\
    \ For example, the `\\b` in ``` regexp.Compile(`hello\\bworld`) ``` matches a\
    \ word boundary, not a backspace character, as within backticks `\\b` is not an\
    \ escape sequence.\n\n\n## References\n* golang.org: [Overview of the Regexp package](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/).\n\

    \ resources. This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted,\

    \nPaths that are naively constructed from data controlled by a user may be absolute\
    \ paths, or may contain unexpected special characters such as \"..\". Such a path\
    \ could point anywhere on the file system.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nValidate user\
    \ input before using it to construct a file path.\n\nCommon validation methods\
    \ include checking that the normalized path is relative and does not contain any\
    \ \"..\" components, or checking that the path is contained within a safe folder.\
    \ The method you should use depends on how the path is used in the application,\
    \ and whether the path should be a single path component.\n\nIf the path should\
    \ be a single path component (such as a file name), you can check for the existence\
    \ of any path separators (\"/\" or \"\\\\\"), or \"..\" sequences in the input,\
    \ and reject the input if any are found.\n\nNote that removing \"../\" sequences\
    \ is *not* sufficient, since the input could still contain a path separator followed\
    \ by \"..\". For example, the input \".../...//\" would still result in the string\
    \ \"../\" if only \"../\" sequences are removed.\n\nFinally, the simplest (but\
    \ most restrictive) option is to use an allow list of safe patterns and make sure\
    \ that the user input matches one of these patterns.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first\
    \ example, a file name is read from an HTTP request and then used to access a\
    \ file. However, a malicious user could enter a file name which is an absolute\
    \ path, such as \"/etc/passwd\".\n\nIn the second example, it appears that the\
    \ user is restricted to opening a file within the `\"user\"` home directory. However,\
    \ a malicious user could enter a file name containing special characters. For\
    \ example, the string `\"../../etc/passwd\"` will result in the code reading the\
    \ file located at \"/home/user/../../etc/passwd\", which is the system's password\
    \ file. This file would then be sent back to the user, giving them access to password\
    \ information.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"net/http\"\
    \n\t\"path/filepath\"\n)\n\nfunc handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)\
    \ {\n\tpath := r.URL.Query()[\"path\"][0]\n\n\t// BAD: This could read any file\

    // BAD: This could still read any file on the file system\n\tdata, _ = ioutil.ReadFile(filepath.Join(\"\
    /home/user/\", path))\n\tw.Write(data)\n}\n\n```\nIf the input should only be\
    \ a file name, you can check that it doesn't contain any path separators or \"\
    ..\" sequences.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"net/http\"\
    \n\t\"path/filepath\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc handler(w http.ResponseWriter,\

    \t\treturn\n\t}\n\tdata, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(filepath.Join(\"/home/user/\", path))\n\
    \tw.Write(data)\n}\n\n```\nNote that this approach is only suitable if the input\
    \ is expected to be a single file name.\n\nIf the input can be a path with multiple\
    \ components, you can make it safe by verifying that the path is within a specific\
    \ directory that is considered safe. You can do this by resolving the input with\
    \ respect to that directory, and then checking that the resulting path is still\
    \ within it.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"net/http\"\
    \n\t\"path/filepath\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nconst safeDir = \"/home/user/\"\n\n\

    \ name\", http.StatusBadRequest)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\tdata, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(absPath)\n\
    \tw.Write(data)\n}\n\n```\nNote that `/home/user` is just an example, you should\
    \ replace it with the actual safe directory in your application. Also, while in\
    \ this example the path of the safe directory is absolute, this may not always\
    \ be the case, and you may need to resolve it first before checking the input.\n\

    \ to prevent writing files or links to unexpected locations.\n\n\n## Example\n\
    In this example, links are extracted from an archive using the syntactic `filepath.Rel`\
    \ function to check whether the link and its target fall within the destination\
    \ directory. However, the extraction code doesn't resolve previously-extracted\
    \ links, so a pair of links like `subdir/parent -> ..` followed by `escape ->\
    \ subdir/parent/.. -> subdir/../..` leaves a link pointing to the parent of the\
    \ archive root. The syntactic `Rel` is ineffective because it equates `subdir/parent/..`\
    \ with `subdir/`, but this is not the case when `subdir/parent` is a symbolic\
    \ link.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"archive/tar\"\n\t\"io\"\n\t\"\
    os\"\n\t\"path/filepath\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc isRel(candidate, target string)\
    \ bool {\n\t// BAD: purely syntactic means are used to check\n\t// that `candidate`\
    \ does not escape from `target`\n\tif filepath.IsAbs(candidate) {\n\t\treturn\
    \ false\n\t}\n\trelpath, err := filepath.Rel(target, filepath.Join(target, candidate))\n\
    \treturn err == nil && !strings.HasPrefix(filepath.Clean(relpath), \"..\")\n}\n\
    \nfunc unzipSymlink(f io.Reader, target string) {\n\tr := tar.NewReader(f)\n\t\
    for {\n\t\theader, err := r.Next()\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t}\n\t\
    \tif isRel(header.Linkname, target) && isRel(header.Name, target) {\n\t\t\tos.Symlink(header.Linkname,\
    \ header.Name)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\n```\nTo fix this vulnerability, resolve pre-existing\
    \ symbolic links before checking that the link's target is acceptable:\n\n\n```go\n\
    package main\n\nfunc isRel(candidate, target string) bool {\n\t// GOOD: resolves\
    \ all symbolic links before checking\n\t// that `candidate` does not escape from\
    \ `target`\n\tif filepath.IsAbs(candidate) {\n\t\treturn false\n\t}\n\trealpath,\
    \ err := filepath.EvalSymlinks(filepath.Join(target, candidate))\n\tif err !=\
    \ nil {\n\t\treturn false\n\t}\n\trelpath, err := filepath.Rel(target, realpath)\n\
    \treturn err == nil && !strings.HasPrefix(filepath.Clean(relpath), \"..\")\n}\n\

  queryHelp: "# Arbitrary file access during archive extraction (\"Zip Slip\")\nExtracting\
    \ files from a malicious zip file, or similar type of archive, is at risk of directory\
    \ traversal attacks if filenames from the archive are not properly validated.\
    \ archive paths.\n\nZip archives contain archive entries representing each file\
    \ in the archive. These entries include a file path for the entry, but these file\
    \ paths are not restricted and may contain unexpected special elements such as\
    \ the directory traversal element (`..`). If these file paths are used to create\
    \ a filesystem path, then a file operation may happen in an unexpected location.\
    \ This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker\
    \ being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if a zip file contains a file entry `..\\sneaky-file`, and the zip file is extracted\
    \ to the directory `c:\\output`, then naively combining the paths would result\
    \ in an output file path of `c:\\output\\..\\sneaky-file`, which would cause the\
    \ file to be written to `c:\\sneaky-file`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that\
    \ output paths constructed from zip archive entries are validated to prevent writing\
    \ files to unexpected locations.\n\nThe recommended way of writing an output file\
    \ from a zip archive entry is to check that \"`..`\" does not occur in the path.\n\
    \n\n## Example\nIn this example an archive is extracted without validating file\
    \ paths. If `archive.zip` contained relative paths (for instance, if it were created\
    \ by something like `zip archive.zip ../file.txt`) then executing this code could\
    \ write to locations outside the destination directory.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\
    \nimport (\n\t\"archive/zip\"\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"path/filepath\"\n)\n\nfunc\
    \ unzip(f string) {\n\tr, _ := zip.OpenReader(f)\n\tfor _, f := range r.File {\n\
    \t\tp, _ := filepath.Abs(f.Name)\n\t\t// BAD: This could overwrite any file on\
    \ the file system\n\t\tioutil.WriteFile(p, []byte(\"present\"), 0666)\n\t}\n}\n\
    \n```\nTo fix this vulnerability, we need to check that the path does not contain\
    \ any \"`..`\" elements in it.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"archive/zip\"\
    \n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"path/filepath\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc unzipGood(f string)\
    \ {\n\tr, _ := zip.OpenReader(f)\n\tfor _, f := range r.File {\n\t\tp, _ := filepath.Abs(f.Name)\n\
    \t\t// GOOD: Check that path does not contain \"..\" before using it\n\t\tif !strings.Contains(f.Name,\
    \ \"..\") {\n\t\t\tioutil.WriteFile(p, []byte(\"present\"), 0666)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\

    \ is built from user-provided data without sufficient sanitization, a malicious\
    \ user may be able to run commands to exfiltrate data or compromise the system.\n\
    \n\n## Recommendation\nWhenever possible, use hard-coded string literals for commands\
    \ and avoid shell string interpreters like `sh -c`.\n\nIf given arguments as a\
    \ single string, avoid simply splitting the string on whitespace. Arguments may\
    \ contain quoted whitespace, causing them to split into multiple arguments.\n\n\
    If this is not possible, sanitize user input to avoid characters like spaces and\
    \ various kinds of quotes that can alter the meaning of the command.\n\n\n## Example\n\
    In the following example, assume the function `handler` is an HTTP request handler\
    \ in a web application, whose parameter `req` contains the request object:\n\n\
    \n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"os/exec\"\n)\n\nfunc handler(req\
    \ *http.Request) {\n\timageName := req.URL.Query()[\"imageName\"][0]\n\toutputPath\
    \ := \"/tmp/output.svg\"\n\tcmd := exec.Command(\"sh\", \"-c\", fmt.Sprintf(\"\
    imagetool %s > %s\", imageName, outputPath))\n\tcmd.Run()\n\t// ...\n}\n\n```\n\
    The handler extracts the image file name from the request and uses the image name\
    \ to construct a shell command that is executed using ``` `sh -c` ```, which can\
    \ lead to command injection.\n\nIt's better to avoid shell commands by using the\
    \ `exec.Command` function directly, as shown in the following example:\n\n\n```go\n\
    package main\n\nimport (\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"os/exec\"\n\
    )\n\nfunc handler(req *http.Request) {\n\timageName := req.URL.Query()[\"imageName\"\
    ][0]\n\toutputPath := \"/tmp/output.svg\"\n\n\t// Create the output file\n\toutfile,\
    \ err := os.Create(outputPath)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\t\
    defer outfile.Close()\n\n\t// Prepare the command\n\tcmd := exec.Command(\"imagetool\"\
    , imageName)\n\n\t// Set the output to our file\n\tcmd.Stdout = outfile\n\n\t\
    cmd.Run()\n}\n\n```\nAlternatively, a regular expression can be used to ensure\
    \ that the image name is safe to use in a shell command:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\
    \nimport (\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"os/exec\"\n\t\"regexp\"\n)\n\nfunc\
    \ handler(req *http.Request) {\n\timageName := req.URL.Query()[\"imageName\"][0]\n\
    \toutputPath := \"/tmp/output.svg\"\n\n\t// Validate the imageName with a regular\
    \ expression\n\tvalidImageName := regexp.MustCompile(`^[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-\\.]+$`)\n\
    \tif !validImageName.MatchString(imageName) {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Invalid image name\"\
    )\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tcmd := exec.Command(\"sh\", \"-c\", fmt.Sprintf(\"imagetool\
    \ %s > %s\", imageName, outputPath))\n\tcmd.Run()\n}\n\n```\nSome commands, like\
    \ `git`, can indirectly execute commands if an attacker specifies the flags given\
    \ to the command.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, either add a `--` argument to ensure\
    \ subsequent arguments are not interpreted as flags, or verify that the argument\
    \ does not start with `\"--\"`.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"log\"\
    \n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"os/exec\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc handler(req *http.Request)\
    \ {\n\trepoURL := req.URL.Query()[\"repoURL\"][0]\n\toutputPath := \"/tmp/repo\"\
    \n\n\t// Sanitize the repoURL to ensure it does not start with \"--\"\n\tif strings.HasPrefix(repoURL,\
    \ \"--\") {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Invalid repository URL\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tcmd :=\
    \ exec.Command(\"git\", \"clone\", repoURL, outputPath)\n\t\terr := cmd.Run()\n\
    \t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// Or: add \"--\" to\

    Sanitize the embedded data appropriately to ensure quotes are escaped, or use\
    \ an API that does not rely on manually constructing quoted substrings. Make sure\
    \ to use the appropriate escaping mechanism, for example, double quoting for SQL\

    \ the backslash character itself must also be escaped.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the\
    \ following example, assume that `version` is an object from an untrusted source.\
    \ The code snippet first uses `json.Marshal` to serialize this object into a string,\
    \ and then embeds it into a SQL query built using the Squirrel library.\n\n\n\

    , \"version_md5\").\n\t\tValues(id, sq.Expr(fmt.Sprintf(\"md5('%s')\", versionJSON))).\n\
    \t\tExec()\n}\n\n```\nNote that JSON encoding does not escape single quotes in\
    \ any way, so this code is vulnerable: any single-quote character in `version`\
    \ will prematurely close the surrounding string literal, changing the structure\
    \ of the SQL expression being constructed. This could be exploited to mount a\
    \ SQL injection attack.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, use the placeholder syntax\
    \ from Squirrel's structured API for building queries, which avoids the need to\
    \ explicitly construct a quoted string.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\
    \t\"encoding/json\"\n\tsq \"github.com/Masterminds/squirrel\"\n)\n\nfunc saveGood(id\
    \ string, version interface{}) {\n\tversionJSON, _ := json.Marshal(version)\n\t\

    , \"version_md5\").\n\t\tValues(id, sq.Expr(\"md5(?)\", versionJSON)).\n\t\tExec()\n\

    \ you escape quotes before embedding user-provided data into a quoted string.\
    \ For example, this is how you can backslash-escape single quotes using `strings.ReplaceAll`:\n\

    \ double quotes, not single quotes (as in the example).\n1. It puts quotes around\
    \ the entire string, so it can only be used to construct complete string literals,\
    \ not parts of larger string literals.\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).\n\

  queryHelp: "# Log entries created from user input\nIf unsanitized user input is\
    \ written to a log entry, a malicious user may be able to forge new log entries.\n\
    \nForgery can occur if a user provides some input with characters that are interpreted\
    \ when the log output is displayed. If the log is displayed as a plain text file,\
    \ then new line characters can be used by a malicious user. If the log is displayed\
    \ as HTML, then arbitrary HTML may be included to spoof log entries.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\
    User input should be suitably encoded before it is logged.\n\nIf the log entries\
    \ are plain text then line breaks should be removed from user input, using `strings.Replace`\
    \ or similar. Care should also be taken that user input is clearly marked in log\
    \ entries, and that a malicious user cannot cause confusion in other ways.\n\n\
    For log entries that will be displayed in HTML, user input should be HTML encoded\
    \ using `html.EscapeString` or similar before being logged, to prevent forgery\
    \ and other forms of HTML injection.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example,\
    \ a user name, provided by the user, is logged using a logging framework without\
    \ any sanitization.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\

    \ is used to ensure no line endings are present in the user input.\n\n\n```go\n\
    package main\n\nimport (\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\n// GOOD:\

  queryHelp: "# Size computation for allocation may overflow\nPerforming calculations\
    \ involving the size of potentially large strings or slices can result in an overflow\
    \ (for signed integer types) or a wraparound (for unsigned types). An overflow\
    \ causes the result of the calculation to become negative, while a wraparound\
    \ results in a small (positive) number.\n\nThis can cause further issues. If,\
    \ for example, the result is then used in an allocation, it will cause a runtime\
    \ panic if it is negative, and allocate an unexpectedly small buffer otherwise.\n\
    \n\n## Recommendation\nAlways guard against overflow in arithmetic operations\
    \ involving potentially large numbers by doing one of the following:\n\n* Validate\
    \ the size of the data from which the numbers are computed.\n* Define a guard\
    \ on the arithmetic expression, so that the operation is performed only if the\
    \ result can be known to be less than, or equal to, the maximum value for the\
    \ type.\n* Use a wider type (such as `uint64` instead of `int`), so that larger\
    \ input values do not cause overflow.\n\n## Example\nIn the following example,\
    \ assume that there is a function `encryptBuffer` that encrypts byte slices whose\
    \ length must be padded to be a multiple of 16. The function `encryptValue` provides\
    \ a convenience wrapper around this function: when passed an arbitrary value,\
    \ it first encodes that value as JSON, pads the resulting byte slice, and then\
    \ passes it to `encryptBuffer`.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"encoding/json\"\
    \n\nfunc encryptValue(v interface{}) ([]byte, error) {\n\tjsonData, err := json.Marshal(v)\n\
    \tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, err\n\t}\n\tsize := len(jsonData) + (len(jsonData)\
    \ % 16)\n\tbuffer := make([]byte, size)\n\tcopy(buffer, jsonData)\n\treturn encryptBuffer(buffer)\n\
    }\n\n```\nWhen passed a value whose JSON encoding is close to the maximum value\
    \ of type `int` in length, the computation of `size` will overflow, producing\
    \ a negative value. When that negative value is passed to `make`, a runtime panic\
    \ will occur.\n\nTo guard against this, the function should be improved to check\
    \ the length of the JSON-encoded value. For example, here is a version of `encryptValue`\
    \ that ensures the value is no larger than 64 MB, which fits comfortably within\
    \ an `int` and avoids the overflow:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"\
    encoding/json\"\n\t\"errors\"\n)\n\nfunc encryptValueGood(v interface{}) ([]byte,\
    \ error) {\n\tjsonData, err := json.Marshal(v)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn\
    \ nil, err\n\t}\n\tif len(jsonData) > 64*1024*1024 {\n\t\treturn nil, errors.New(\"\
    value too large\")\n\t}\n\tsize := len(jsonData) + (len(jsonData) % 16)\n\tbuffer\
    \ := make([]byte, size)\n\tcopy(buffer, jsonData)\n\treturn encryptBuffer(buffer)\n\
    }\n\n```\n\n## References\n* The Go Programming Language Specification: [Integer\

    \ be secure anymore because of various security vulnerabilities, and tht makes\
    \ them unfit for use in securing your applications.\n\nUnfortunately, many applications\
    \ and websites still support deprecated SSL/TLS versions and cipher suites.\n\n\
    \n## Recommendation\nOnly use secure TLS versions (1.3 and 1.2) and avoid using\

    \ TLS configuration can be created:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"\
    crypto/tls\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {}\n\nfunc insecureMinMaxTlsVersion() {\n\t{\n\t\
    \tconfig := &tls.Config{}\n\t\tconfig.MinVersion = 0 // BAD: Setting the MinVersion\
    \ to 0 equals to choosing the lowest supported version (i.e. SSL3.0)\n\t}\n\t\
    {\n\t\tconfig := &tls.Config{}\n\t\tconfig.MinVersion = tls.VersionSSL30 // BAD:\
    \ SSL 3.0 is a non-secure version of the protocol; it's not safe to use it as\
    \ MinVersion.\n\t}\n\t{\n\t\tconfig := &tls.Config{}\n\t\tconfig.MaxVersion =\
    \ tls.VersionSSL30 // BAD: SSL 3.0 is a non-secure version of the protocol; it's\
    \ not safe to use it as MaxVersion.\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc insecureCipherSuites() {\n\
    \tconfig := &tls.Config{\n\t\tCipherSuites: []uint16{\n\t\t\ttls.TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA,\
    \ // BAD: TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA is one of the non-secure cipher suites; it's\
    \ not safe to be used.\n\t\t},\n\t}\n\t_ = config\n}\n\n```\nThe following example\
    \ shows how to create a safer TLS configuration:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\n\
    import \"crypto/tls\"\n\nfunc saferTLSConfig() {\n\tconfig := &tls.Config{}\n\t\
    config.MinVersion = tls.VersionTLS12\n\tconfig.MaxVersion = tls.VersionTLS13\n\
    \t// OR\n\tconfig.MaxVersion = 0 // GOOD: Setting MaxVersion to 0 means that the\
    \ highest version available in the package will be used.\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n\

  queryHelp: "# Use of insufficient randomness as the key of a cryptographic algorithm\n\
    Using a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator to generate a security-sensitive\
    \ value, such as a password, makes it easier for an attacker to predict the value.\n\
    \nPseudo-random number generators generate a sequence of numbers that only approximates\
    \ the properties of random numbers. The sequence is not truly random because it\
    \ is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values, the seed.\
    \ If the random number generator is cryptographically weak, then this sequence\
    \ may be easily predictable through outside observations.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\
    Use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator if the output is\
    \ to be used in a security sensitive context. As a rule of thumb, a value should\
    \ be considered \"security sensitive\" if predicting it would allow the attacker\
    \ to perform an action that they would otherwise be unable to perform. For example,\
    \ if an attacker could predict the random password generated for a new user, they\
    \ would be able to log in as that new user.\n\nFor Go, `crypto/rand` provides\
    \ a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. `math/rand` is not\
    \ cryptographically secure, and should be avoided in security contexts. For contexts\
    \ which are not security sensitive, `math/rand` may be preferable as it has a\
    \ more convenient interface, and is likely to be faster.\n\n\n## Example\nThe\
    \ example below uses the `math/rand` package instead of `crypto/rand` to generate\
    \ a password:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"math/rand\"\n)\n\nvar\
    \ charset = []rune(\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789\"\
    )\n\nfunc generatePassword() string {\n\ts := make([]rune, 20)\n\tfor i := range\
    \ s {\n\t\ts[i] = charset[rand.Intn(len(charset))]\n\t}\n\treturn string(s)\n\
    }\n\n```\nInstead, use `crypto/rand`:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\
    \"crypto/rand\"\n\t\"math/big\"\n)\n\nfunc generatePasswordGood() string {\n\t\
    s := make([]rune, 20)\n\tfor i := range s {\n\t\tidx, err := rand.Int(rand.Reader,\
    \ big.NewInt(int64(len(charset))))\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\t// handle err\n\
    \t\t}\n\t\ts[i] = charset[idx.Int64()]\n\t}\n\treturn string(s)\n}\n\n```\n\n\

    \n\n## Example\nIn the first example, the code accepts a username specified by\
    \ the user, and uses this unvalidated and unsanitized value in an XPath expression.\
    \ This is vulnerable to the user providing special characters or string sequences\
    \ that change the meaning of the XPath expression to search for different values.\n\

  queryHelp: "# Incorrect conversion between integer types\nIf a string is parsed\
    \ into an int using `strconv.Atoi`, and subsequently that int is converted into\
    \ another integer type of a smaller size, the result can produce unexpected values.\n\
    \nThis also applies to the results of `strconv.ParseInt` and `strconv.ParseUint`\
    \ when the specified size is larger than the size of the type that number is converted\
    \ to.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIf you need to parse integer values with specific\
    \ bit sizes, avoid `strconv.Atoi`, and instead use `strconv.ParseInt` or `strconv.ParseUint`,\
    \ which also allow specifying the bit size.\n\nWhen using those functions, be\
    \ careful to not convert the result to another type with a smaller bit size than\
    \ the bit size you specified when parsing the number.\n\nIf this is not possible,\
    \ then add upper (and lower) bound checks specific to each type and bit size (you\
    \ can find the minimum and maximum value for each type in the `math` package).\n\
    \nNote that CodeQL is only able to identify bounds checks that compare against\
    \ a constant value. When a variable is used in the comparison, CodeQL is unable\
    \ to determine the value of the variable at runtime and will not recognize the\
    \ bounds check.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first example, assume that an input string\
    \ is passed to `parseAllocateBad1` function, parsed by `strconv.Atoi`, and then\
    \ converted into an `int32` type:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"strconv\"\
    \n)\n\nfunc parseAllocateBad1(wanted string) int32 {\n\tparsed, err := strconv.Atoi(wanted)\n\
    \tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\treturn int32(parsed)\n}\nfunc parseAllocateBad2(wanted\
    \ string) int32 {\n\tparsed, err := strconv.ParseInt(wanted, 10, 64)\n\tif err\
    \ != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\treturn int32(parsed)\n}\n\n```\nThe bounds\
    \ are not checked, so this means that if the provided number is greater than the\
    \ maximum value of type `int32`, the resulting value from the conversion will\
    \ be different from the actual provided value.\n\nTo avoid unexpected values,\
    \ you should either use the other functions provided by the `strconv` package\
    \ to parse the specific types and bit sizes as shown in the `parseAllocateGood2`\
    \ function; or check bounds as in the `parseAllocateGood1` function.\n\n\n```go\n\
    package main\n\nimport (\n\t\"math\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n}\n\
    \nconst DefaultAllocate int32 = 256\n\nfunc parseAllocateGood1(desired string)\
    \ int32 {\n\tparsed, err := strconv.Atoi(desired)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn\
    \ DefaultAllocate\n\t}\n\t// GOOD: check for lower and upper bounds\n\tif parsed\
    \ > 0 && parsed <= math.MaxInt32 {\n\t\treturn int32(parsed)\n\t}\n\treturn DefaultAllocate\n\
    }\nfunc parseAllocateGood2(desired string) int32 {\n\t// GOOD: parse specifying\
    \ the bit size\n\tparsed, err := strconv.ParseInt(desired, 10, 32)\n\tif err !=\
    \ nil {\n\t\treturn DefaultAllocate\n\t}\n\treturn int32(parsed)\n}\n\nfunc parseAllocateGood3(wanted\
    \ string) int32 {\n\tparsed, err := strconv.ParseInt(wanted, 10, 32)\n\tif err\
    \ != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\treturn int32(parsed)\n}\nfunc parseAllocateGood4(wanted\
    \ string) int32 {\n\tparsed, err := strconv.ParseInt(wanted, 10, 64)\n\tif err\
    \ != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\t// GOOD: check for lower and uppper bounds\n\
    \tif parsed > 0 && parsed <= math.MaxInt32 {\n\t\treturn int32(parsed)\n\t}\n\t\
    return DefaultAllocate\n}\n\n```\n\n## Example\nIn the second example, assume\
    \ that an input string is passed to `parseAllocateBad2` function, parsed by `strconv.ParseInt`\
    \ with a bit size set to 64, and then converted into an `int32` type:\n\n\n```go\n\
    package main\n\nimport (\n\t\"strconv\"\n)\n\nfunc parseAllocateBad1(wanted string)\
    \ int32 {\n\tparsed, err := strconv.Atoi(wanted)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\
    \t}\n\treturn int32(parsed)\n}\nfunc parseAllocateBad2(wanted string) int32 {\n\
    \tparsed, err := strconv.ParseInt(wanted, 10, 64)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\
    \t}\n\treturn int32(parsed)\n}\n\n```\nIf the provided number is greater than\
    \ the maximum value of type `int32`, the resulting value from the conversion will\
    \ be different from the actual provided value.\n\nTo avoid unexpected values,\
    \ you should specify the correct bit size as in `parseAllocateGood3`; or check\
    \ bounds before making the conversion as in `parseAllocateGood4`.\n\n\n```go\n\
    package main\n\nimport (\n\t\"math\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n}\n\
    \nconst DefaultAllocate int32 = 256\n\nfunc parseAllocateGood1(desired string)\

    Implement a maximum allowed value for size allocations with the built-in `make`\
    \ function to prevent excessively large allocations.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following\
    \ example snippet, the `n` parameter is user-controlled.\n\nIf the external user\

    \ `n` without further verification, potentially exhausting all the available memory.\n\

  queryHelp: "# Uncontrolled data used in network request\nDirectly incorporating\
    \ user input into an HTTP request without validating the input can facilitate\
    \ different kinds of request forgery attacks, where the attacker essentially controls\
    \ the request. If the vulnerable request is in server-side code, then security\
    \ mechanisms, such as external firewalls, can be bypassed. If the vulnerable request\
    \ is in client-side code, then unsuspecting users can send malicious requests\
    \ to other servers, potentially resulting in a DDOS attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\
    To guard against request forgery, it is advisable to avoid putting user input\
    \ directly into a network request. If a flexible network request mechanism is\
    \ required, it is recommended to maintain a list of authorized request targets\
    \ and choose from that list based on the user input provided.\n\n\n## Example\n\
    The following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a\
    \ URL request without validating the input, which facilitates an SSRF attack.\
    \ The request `http.Get(...)` is vulnerable since attackers can choose the value\
    \ of `target` to be anything they want. For instance, the attacker can choose\
    \ `\"internal.example.com/#\"` as the target, causing the URL used in the request\
    \ to be `\"https://internal.example.com/#.example.com/data\"`.\n\nA request to\
    \ `https://internal.example.com` may be problematic if that server is not meant\
    \ to be directly accessible from the attacker's machine.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\
    \nimport (\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc handler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request)\
    \ {\n\ttarget := req.FormValue(\"target\")\n\n\t// BAD: `target` is controlled\
    \ by the attacker\n\tresp, err := http.Get(\"https://\" + target + \".example.com/data/\"\
    )\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\t// error handling\n\t}\n\n\t// process request response\n\
    \tuse(resp)\n}\n\n```\nOne way to remedy the problem is to use the user input\
    \ to select a known fixed string before performing the request:\n\n\n```go\npackage\
    \ main\n\nimport (\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc handler1(w http.ResponseWriter,\
    \ req *http.Request) {\n\ttarget := req.FormValue(\"target\")\n\n\tvar subdomain\
    \ string\n\tif target == \"EU\" {\n\t\tsubdomain = \"europe\"\n\t} else {\n\t\t\
    subdomain = \"world\"\n\t}\n\n\t// GOOD: `subdomain` is controlled by the server\n\
    \tresp, err := http.Get(\"https://\" + subdomain + \".example.com/data/\")\n\t\
    if err != nil {\n\t\t// error handling\n\t}\n\n\t// process request response\n\
