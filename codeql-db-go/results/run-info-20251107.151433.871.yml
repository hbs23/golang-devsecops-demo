  queryHelp: "# Constant length comparison\nIndexing operations on arrays, slices,\
    \ or strings should use an index at most one less than the length. If the operation\
    \ uses a variable index but checks the length against a constant, this may indicate\
    \ a logic error which could lead to an out-of-bounds access.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\
    Inspect the code closely to determine whether the length should be compared to\
    \ the index variable instead. For loops that iterate over every element, using\
    \ a `range` loop is better than explicit index manipulation.\n\n\n## Example\n\
    The following example shows a method which checks whether slice `xs` is a prefix\
    \ of slice `ys`:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nfunc isPrefixOf(xs, ys []int) bool\
    \ {\n\tfor i := 0; i < len(xs); i++ {\n\t\tif len(ys) == 0 || xs[i] != ys[i] {\n\
    \t\t\treturn false\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn true\n}\n\n```\nA loop using an index\
    \ variable `i` is used to iterate over the elements of `xs` and compare them to\
    \ the corresponding elements of `ys`. However, the check to ensure that `i` is\
    \ a valid index into `ys` is incorrectly specified as `len(ys) == 0`. Instead,\
    \ the check should ensure that `len(ys)` is greater than `i`:\n\n\n```go\npackage\
    \ main\n\nfunc isPrefixOfGood(xs, ys []int) bool {\n\tfor i := 0; i < len(xs);\
    \ i++ {\n\t\tif len(ys) <= i || xs[i] != ys[i] {\n\t\t\treturn false\n\t\t}\n\t\
    }\n\treturn true\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* The Go Programming Language Specification:\

  queryHelp: "# Wrapped error is always nil\nThe `pkg.errors` package provides the\
    \ `errors.Wrap` function for annotating an error with a stack trace. When passed\
    \ `nil`, this function returns `nil`. When the first parameter to `errors.Wrap`\
    \ is *always* `nil`, the function call has no effect and likely indicates a programming\
    \ mistake. A common example of this is when an `errors.Wrap(err, \"message\")`\
    \ call is copied from an earlier error-handling block in the same function and\
    \ used in a subsequent error-handling block that does not check `err` in its guard.\
    \ In this case the return of a `nil` value to the caller indicates by convention\
    \ that the operation succeeded, and so the failure is masked.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\
    Usually an `err` value is being referenced outside its intended scope. The problem\
    \ can be fixed by removing that reference, for example by changing a call of the\
    \ form `errors.Wrap(err, \"message\")` to `errors.New(\"message\")`.\n\n\n## Example\n\
    The example below shows an example where the `err` value returned from the call\
    \ to `f1` is reused in a later call, when it is known to be `nil`:\n\n\n```go\n\

    \ error {\n\tif input == \"1\" {\n\t\treturn errors.Errorf(\"error in f1\")\n\t\

    2\" {\n\t\treturn false, errors.Errorf(\"error in f2\")\n\t}\n\treturn true, nil\n\
    }\n\nfunc test1(input string) error {\n\terr := f1(input)\n\tif err != nil {\n\
    \t\treturn errors.Wrap(err, \"input is the first non-negative integer\")\n\t}\n\

    \ non-negative integer\")\n\t}\n\treturn nil\n}\n\n```\nOne way of fixing this\
    \ is to create a new error value with `errors.New`:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\
    \nimport (\n\t\"github.com/pkg/errors\"\n)\n\nfunc f1(input string) error {\n\t\
    if input == \"1\" {\n\t\treturn errors.Errorf(\"error in f1\")\n\t}\n\treturn\
    \ nil\n}\n\nfunc f2(input string) (bool, error) {\n\tif input == \"2\" {\n\t\t\
    return false, errors.Errorf(\"error in f2\")\n\t}\n\treturn true, nil\n}\n\nfunc\

  queryHelp: "# Redundant call to recover\nThe built-in `recover` function is only\
    \ useful inside deferred functions. Calling it in a function that is never deferred\
    \ means that it will always return `nil` and it will never regain control of a\
    \ panicking goroutine. The same is true of calling `recover` directly in a defer\
    \ statement.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nCarefully inspect the code to determine whether\
    \ it is a mistake that should be fixed.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the example below,\
    \ the function `fun1` is intended to recover from the panic. However, the function\
    \ that is deferred calls another function, which then calls `recover`:\n\n\n```go\n\
    package main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc callRecover1() {\n\tif recover() != nil\
    \ {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"recovered\")\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc fun1() {\n\tdefer func() {\n\
    \t\tcallRecover1()\n\t}()\n\tpanic(\"1\")\n}\n\n```\nThis problem can be fixed\
    \ by deferring the call to the function which calls `recover`:\n\n\n```go\npackage\
    \ main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc callRecover1Good() {\n\tif recover() != nil {\n\
    \t\tfmt.Printf(\"recovered\")\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc fun1Good() {\n\tdefer callRecover1Good()\n\
    \tpanic(\"1\")\n}\n\n```\nIn the following example, `recover` is called directly\
    \ in a defer statement, which has no effect, so the panic is not caught.\n\n\n\
    ```go\npackage main\n\nfunc fun2() {\n\tdefer recover()\n\tpanic(\"2\")\n}\n\n\
    ```\nWe can fix this by instead deferring an anonymous function which calls `recover`.\n\
    \n\n```go\npackage main\n\nfunc fun2Good() {\n\tdefer func() { recover() }()\n\
    \tpanic(\"2\")\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* [Defer, Panic, and Recover - The\

    \ Recommendation\nCarefully inspect the assignment to check for misspellings or\
    \ missing qualifiers.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the example below, the struct type `Rect`\
    \ has two setter methods `setWidth` and `setHeight` that are meant to be used\
    \ to update the `width` and `height` fields, respectively:\n\n\n```go\npackage\
    \ main\n\ntype Rect struct {\n\tx, y, width, height int\n}\n\nfunc (r *Rect) setWidth(width\
    \ int) {\n\tr.width = width\n}\n\nfunc (r *Rect) setHeight(height int) {\n\theight\
    \ = height\n}\n\n```\nNote, however, that in `setHeight` the programmer forgot\
    \ to qualify the left-hand side of the assignment with the receiver variable `r`,\
    \ so the method performs a useless assignment of the `width` parameter to itself\
    \ and leaves the `width` field unchanged.\n\nTo fix this issue, insert a qualifier:\n\
    \n\n```go\npackage main\n\nfunc (r *Rect) setHeightGood(height int) {\n\tr.height\
    \ = height\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* The Go Programming Language Specification:\
